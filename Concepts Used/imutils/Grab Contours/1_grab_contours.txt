The grab_contours function in the "imutils" library is a utility function designed to simplify 
the process of extracting contours from the output of the cv2.findContours function in OpenCV. 
It's especially useful when you want to quickly access the list of detected contours without 
needing to handle the hierarchy that cv2.findContours returns.


Background:
In OpenCV, when you use the cv2.findContours function to detect contours in an image, it returns 
a tuple containing contours and a hierarchy. Contours are stored in a list, while the hierarchy 
is a structure that provides information about the relationships between the contours. 
For many basic tasks, you typically only need the list of contours and not the hierarchy.


Purpose of grab_contours:
imutils.grab_contours simplifies the process of extracting the contours by checking the input 
structure and taking the following actions:
1. If the input to grab_contours is a tuple, it assumes that it's the output of cv2.findContours 
    and extracts the contours (the first element of the tuple). This is the most common usage.
2. If the input is already a list of contours (i.e., it's not a tuple), grab_contours returns 
    that list without any changes. This allows you to use the function on the result of 
    cv2.findContours without needing to check the data type first.


Benefits:
The primary benefit of using grab_contours is code simplification and enhanced readability. 
It's especially useful in scenarios where you don't want to deal with the hierarchy of contours 
and only need the list of contours for further processing. 
By using this utility function, you can write cleaner and more concise code.
