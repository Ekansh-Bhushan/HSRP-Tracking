In OpenCV, the cv2.drawContours function is used to draw contours on an image. 
Contours are the boundaries of objects in an image, and the drawContours function allows you to 
visualize these boundaries by drawing them on the image. 
This is a fundamental operation in computer vision and image processing.

Here's a breakdown of the function's parameters and how it works:
output_image = cv2.drawContours(image, contours, contourIdx, color, thickness[, lineType[, hierarchy[, maxLevel[, offset]]]])

1. image: 
    The input image on which you want to draw the contours. 
    This should be the image on which the contours were originally detected.
2. contours: 
    A list of contours that you want to draw. 
    Each contour is represented as a list of points, each point typically specified as (x, y).
3. contourIdx (Optional): 
    An parameter specifying the index of the contour to draw from the list of contours.
    If set to -1, all contours in the list will be drawn.
4. color: 
    The color of the contours. It can be specified as a tuple of (B, G, R) values, where B, G, 
    and R represent the intensity of blue, green, and red, respectively.
5. thickness: 
    The thickness of the contour lines.
    A positive integer value sets the thickness in pixels. 
    A value of -1 fills the contour.
6. lineType (Optional): 
    An parameter that specifies the type of line used to draw the contours. 
    The default value is cv2.LINE_8.
7. hierarchy (Optional): 
    An parameter that provides information about the relationships between contours. 
    This is not commonly used when drawing contours.
8. maxLevel (Optional): 
    An parameter that specifies the maximum level in the hierarchy to draw. 
    It is not commonly used when drawing contours.
9. offset (Optional): 
    An parameter that specifies an offset to be added to the points of the contour. 
    It can be used to adjust the position of the drawn contours.


How cv2.drawContours Works:
The cv2.drawContours function draws the specified contours on the input image. 
It can be used to visualize the boundaries of objects, shapes, or regions detected in the image. 
The function typically follows these steps:
1. It takes the input image and the list of contours as parameters.
2. For each contour, it connects the points in the contour list with line segments to draw the 
    boundary of the object.
3. The color parameter determines the color of the contour lines.
4. The thickness parameter specifies the line thickness in pixels.
    A value of -1 fills the interior of the contour.
5. The lineType parameter specifies the type of line used to draw the contours, with cv2.LINE_8 
    as the default.


Usage of cv2.drawContours:
The cv2.drawContours function is widely used in various computer vision and image processing 
tasks. Some common use cases include:
1. Object Detection: 
    To draw boundaries around detected objects in an image.
2. Image Segmentation: 
    To visualize regions or segments of interest.
3. Shape Analysis: 
    To analyze and visualize shapes and their boundaries.
4. Feature Extraction: 
    To extract and visualize features such as corners, edges, or blobs.
