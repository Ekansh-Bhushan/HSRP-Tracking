The cv2.findContours() function in OpenCV is used for finding contours in binary and grayscale 
images. Contours are simply the boundaries of objects within an image. 
This function is a fundamental tool in computer vision and image processing, and it plays a 
crucial role in tasks such as object detection, shape analysis, and image segmentation.

Here's a breakdown of the function's parameters and how it works:
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(image, mode, method[, contours[, offset]])

1. image: 
    The input image on which you want to find contours. 
    This image should typically be in grayscale or binary format. 
    You can create a binary image using techniques like thresholding or edge detection.
2. mode: 
    The contour retrieval mode, which specifies how the contours are retrieved. 
    It can take one of the following values:
    (A) cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL: 
        Retrieves only the external (outermost) contours.
    (B) cv2.RETR_LIST: 
        Retrieves all contours without any hierarchy.
    (C) cv2.RETR_CCOMP: 
        Retrieves all contours organized into a two-level hierarchy. 
        The top-level contains external contours, & second level contains contours inside holes.
    (D) cv2.RETR_TREE: 
        Retrieves all contours in a full hierarchy.
3. method: 
    The contour approximation method, which specifies how the contours are stored. 
    It can take one of the following values:
    (A) cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE: 
        Stores all the contour points and doesn't remove any redundant points.
    (B) cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE: 
        Compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and leaves only their end points. 
        For example, a straight line will be stored as two end points.
4. contours (optional): 
    A Python list where the detected contours will be stored. 
    Each contour is represented as a list of points (x, y) that define the contour.
4. hierarchy (optional): 
    A numpy array that represents the hierarchy of contours. 
    It's used in hierarchical retrieval modes (cv2.RETR_CCOMP and cv2.RETR_TREE) to establish 
    the relationships between contours.


How cv2.findContours() Works:
The cv2.findContours() function goes through several steps:
1. Preprocessing: 
    Typically, you apply some image processing techniques such as thresholding or edge detection 
    to convert the input image into a binary image with clear object boundaries.
2. Contour Detection: 
    The function then identifies and detects contours within the binary image. It searches for 
    continuous regions of white (object) pixels in the binary image.
3. Contour Representation: 
    Detected contours are represented as lists of points, where each point (x, y) lies on the 
    contour. The contours are stored in the contours list.
4. Hierarchy (Optional): 
    If you use hierarchical retrieval modes (cv2.RETR_CCOMP or cv2.RETR_TREE), the hierarchy of 
    contours is stored in the hierarchy array. This hierarchy provides information about the 
    relationships between contours, such as parent-child relationships.


Usage of cv2.findContours():
The cv2.findContours() function is used in various computer vision and image processing tasks, 
including object detection, image segmentation, shape analysis, and more. 
After detecting and storing contours, you can use them for various purposes, such as drawing 
them on the original image, extracting object features, or identifying objects.
