In NumPy, the numpy.where function is used to return the indices of elements in an array that 
satisfy a given condition. This function is a powerful tool for extracting specific elements or 
performing conditional operations on NumPy arrays.

Here's a breakdown of the function's parameters and how it works:
numpy.where(condition[, x, y])

1. condition: 
    This is the condition that you want to apply to the array. 
    It can be a boolean expression or an array of boolean values. 
    If the condition is True for an element, that element's index will be returned.
2. x (optional): 
    This parameter represents the values to be used for elements in the result where the 
    condition is True. 
    If not provided, the function returns the indices where the condition is True.
3. y (optional): 
    This parameter represents the values to be used for elements in the result where the 
    condition is False. 
    If not provided, the function returns the indices where the condition is True.


Return Value:
The numpy.where function returns a tuple of arrays containing the indices of elements that 
satisfy the condition. 
If x and y are provided, the returned tuple contains the indices where the condition is True 
and the indices where the condition is False, respectively.


How numpy.where Works:
The numpy.where function evaluates the condition for each element in the input array and returns 
the indices where the condition is True. 
It's often used for searching, filtering, or modifying elements in the array based on a specific 
condition. 
The optional x and y parameters allow you to specify replacement values for elements based on 
whether the condition is True or False.


The numpy.where function is a versatile tool for working with NumPy arrays, as it allows you 
to find elements that meet specific conditions and perform element-wise replacements based on 
those conditions.
