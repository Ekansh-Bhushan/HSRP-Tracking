The cv2.threshold() function in OpenCV is used to perform image thresholding, which is a commonly used 
technique in image processing to separate the regions of an image that are of interest from those that 
are not. Thresholding is used to create binary images, where each pixel is assigned one of two values 
(usually 0 or 255) based on whether it meets a certain condition.

Here's a breakdown of the function's parameters and how it works:
cv2.threshold(image, threshold_value, max_value, threshold_type)

1. image: 
    This is the input image you want to threshold. It should be a single-channel (grayscale) image.
2. threshold_value: 
    This is the value that is used as a threshold. Pixels in the input image are compared to this 
    threshold value.
3. max_value: 
    This is the value to be assigned to pixels that meet the threshold condition. Typically, it's set 
    to 0 and 255 for binary thresholding (black and white images).
4. threshold_type: 
    This parameter specifies type of thresholding to be applied. Some common threshold types include:
    (A) cv2.THRESH_BINARY: 
        If a pixel value is greater than threshold, it's set to max_value, otherwise, it's set to 0.
    (B) cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV: 
        The inverse of cv2.THRESH_BINARY. 
        If a pixel value is greater than threshold, it's set to 0, otherwise, it's set to max_value.
    (C) cv2.THRESH_TRUNC: 
        If a pixel value is greater than threshold, it's set to the threshold value; otherwise, it's 
        not changed.
    (D) cv2.THRESH_TOZERO: 
        If a pixel value is greater than threshold, it's not changed; otherwise, it's set to 0.
    (E) cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV: 
        The inverse of cv2.THRESH_TOZERO. 
        If a pixel value is greater than threshold, it's set to 0; otherwise, it's not changed.
