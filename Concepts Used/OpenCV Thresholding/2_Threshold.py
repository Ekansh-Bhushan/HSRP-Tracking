# Example of how to use cv2.threshold() to perform binary thresholding

import cv2

# Load an image (should be a grayscale image)
image = cv2.imread('vehicle_image2.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Set the threshold value
threshold_value = 40

# Set the max value for pixels that meet the threshold
max_value = 255

# Apply binary thresholding
ret, thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(image, threshold_value, max_value, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Display the thresholded image
cv2.imshow('Thresholded Image', thresholded_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()




# In this example, the function takes the input grayscale image, applies binary thresholding, and stores 
# the thresholded result in thresholded_image. You can adjust the threshold_value and max_value to 
# control the thresholding behavior based on your specific image and requirements.
