ACCESSING HSV COMPONENTS:
In OpenCV, you can access the individual HSV components (Hue, Saturation, Value) as separate channels 
in the HSV image. This allows you to work with each component independently for various image 
processing tasks. Here's how to access and understand each component:

1. Hue (H):
    Hue represents the color information and is the most visually distinctive component.
    Hue values range from 0 to 179 in OpenCV (0-360 degrees in some applications).
    To access the Hue channel, you can simply use indexing: hsv_image[:, :, 0].

2. Saturation (S):
    Saturation represents the color intensity or vividness.
    It's values range from 0 (completely unsaturated, grayscale) to 255 (fully saturated, intense color).
    To access the Saturation channel: hsv_image[:, :, 1].

3. Value (V):
    Value represents the brightness of the color.
    Value values range from 0 (completely dark, black) to 255 (fully bright, white).
    To access the Value channel: hsv_image[:, :, 2].


THRESHOLDING BASED ON HSV:
Thresholding based on HSV allows you to isolate specific color ranges or intensities in your image. 
You can create masks to segment regions with desired hues, saturations, or values.
