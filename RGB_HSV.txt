In the context of number plate detection, whether to use RGB or HSV color space depends on the specific 
requirements and characteristics of the images you are working with. Each color space has its advantages 
and may be more suitable for different scenarios:

1. RGB Color Space:
   - RGB represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue channels.
   - It is the most common color space and is widely used for general image processing.
   - If the color of the number plates in your images is relatively consistent and distinct from the 
    background, RGB can work well.

2. HSV Color Space:
   - HSV separates color information from brightness information, making it often more suitable for 
    color-based tasks.
   - It's particularly useful for detecting objects based on their color, as it is less sensitive to 
    variations in lighting conditions.
   - If the color of the number plates varies slightly or if the background color is similar to the 
    text color, HSV can be more robust in distinguishing them.

In many cases, HSV is preferred for color-based object detection, including number plate detection, 
because it can handle variations in lighting conditions better and makes it easier to define color 
thresholds for segmentation.

Here are some considerations for choosing between RGB and HSV for number plate detection:

- Use RGB if: 
    The number plates have very consistent & distinct color, & the background color does not interfere 
    with detection. In cases where you're dealing with simple scenarios, RGB might be sufficient.

- Use HSV if: 
    The color of the number plates can vary slightly, or background color is similar to text color. 
    HSV can provide a more robust approach to distinguishing colors under varying lighting conditions.
